# The Analysis
The following queries are designed to answer each of the five questions outlined in the background section. 📊❓ Below each query, you'll find a visualization of the results, followed by the insights. 👀💡 Here is the approach. 🚀

### 1. top paying data analyst jobs
To identify the highiest paying roles, I filtered data analyst position by average yearly salary and location, focusing on remote jobs. This query highlights the high paying opportunities in the field.

```sql
SELECT
    job_id,
    name AS company_name,
    job_title,
    job_location,
    job_schedule_type,
    salary_year_avg,
    job_posted_date
FROM
    job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE
    job_title_short ='Data Analyst' AND
    job_location = 'Anywhere' AND
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10
```
